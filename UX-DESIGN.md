## Site Prototype 
[Link to Site Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/CYLPLEl7Iq3l6b4s67Qb20/gesturetalk-Wireframe-and-Prototype?node-id=6-2&p=f&t=63xqQjh0fmtifJg9-0&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=6%3A2&show-proto-sidebar=1&device-frame=0)

Our site prototype utilizes an easily readable, familiar GUI that someone hard of hearing could use even if they are not familiar with technology. We hoped to make it as easy as possible for users to join/create a meeting, as the point of our app is to provide more accessibility to hard of hearing users -- not less. It follows the design principles of similar video calling apps like Zoom. There are two "flows" in our site prototype. Flow 1 relates to a user who has already signed up and is still logged in. It takes the user directly to the home page where they can start or join a meeting. Users will also be able to access the profile page when logged in where they can change information like their picture, screen namem etc.. Flow 2 relates to a user who needs to sign-in or sign-up before accessing gesturetalk. All users will be required to make an account in order to use gesturetalk.

Our web app will have 5 distinct pages as seen above. A user upon opening the app for the first time will be prompted to log-in / sign-up. If a logged-in user has cookies enabled, they will be directed to the home page immediately where they can join or create a gesturetalk meeting. A logged-in user from the home page can also access their profile where they will be able to change information like their screen name, etc.. Creating or joining a meeting will redirect the user to a meeting page.
