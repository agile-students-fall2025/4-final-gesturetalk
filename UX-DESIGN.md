Our web app will have 5 distinct pages as seen above. A user upon opening the app for the first time will be prompted to log-in / sign-up. If a logged-in user has cookies enabled, they will be directed to the home page immediately where they can join or create a gesturetalk meeting. A logged-in user from the home page can also access their profile where they will be able to change information like their screen name, etc.. Creating or joining a meeting will redirect the user to a meeting page.
